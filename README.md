# Frontend Mentor - QR code component

This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). 

- [Built with]()
    -Flexbox for alignment
    -basic CSS and HTML
- [What I learned]()
    - Why the CSS margin-top style works differently dependent on the classes assigned to the divs:
    (Reference https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9519841/why-does-this-css-margin-top-style-not-work)
    and how to solve it using the inline-block property.
- [My Proccess]()
    - I started by creating 3 <divs />; the first to assign the flexbox property to, the second one to assign general styling for the outer 'box' to,
      and the third which held the image and two text items in it
    - the .content class holds the 'text align: center;' property, as all elements within the third div need to center-aligned - this prevents repetition
    - I started by styling the outer border of the divs first, then the alignments of elements within the divs (this includes padding, defining the size of the image & text) and then I went to styling (assigning the proper colors to the respected elements, making sure that margins & paddings are as showcased inside of the "./design" folder) - Since I didn't have access to the figma or sketch file, I had to guess and play around with the exact sizing of the main div, but eventually found a good value.
